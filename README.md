The Snake Water Gun Game is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that brings the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" game concept into a fun and interactive digital format. The game is based on the popular hand game but with a twist, using "Snake," "Water," and "Gun" as the three options instead of the traditional "Rock," "Paper," and "Scissors."
